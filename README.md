## References

AngularJS [https://angularjs.org]

## Usage
you can see the samples folder for more help

First you must to add the dependency to your project

```javascript
    angular.module("MyModule", ["ngC3"]);
```

Second you must create a tag called ng-c3 with these attributes

```html
<ng-c3 chart-id="chartId" series="chart.series" options="chart.options"></ng-c3>

```
Then go to the controller and create the JSON that the chart will use

```javascript
    angular.module("myModule")
        .controller("MyCtrl", ["$scope", 
            function ($scope) {
                $scope.chart = {
                    options: {
                        type: "line",
                        onclick : function (point) {
                            console.log("point: ", point);
                        },
                    },
                    series: [
                        {
                            name: "Data 1",
                            data: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
                        }, 
                        {
                            name: "Data 2",
                            data: [{x: 1, y: 20}, {x: 3, y: 40}, {x: 5, y: 60}]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }]);
```

how you can see, there is two way to set the data, with an Array of Arrays or Array of JSONs

### Enjoy the Directive
